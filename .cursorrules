# Features
- Notion webhook integration: Create tasks via HTTP requests
- More integrations planned: Calendar sync, Perplexity API, etc.

# Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic
- Environment: .env file with API keys
- Testing: pytest
- Deployment: Docker + Docker Compose, Terraform for AWS EC2

# Execution
python run.py # Starts FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000 

# Deployment Workflow
# IMPORTANT: Production deployment follows this specific workflow:
# 1. Develop and test locally first (python run.py)
# 2. Commit and push changes to the public GitHub repository (main branch)
# 3. Run terraform apply from the terraform directory to update production
# Note: EC2 instance pulls code directly from GitHub, not your local machine
# Changes must be in GitHub repo before they appear in production

# AWS Deployment
# First configure AWS CLI with your credentials and region:
aws configure # Provide AWS access key, secret key, and region
# Then run Terraform commands:
cd terraform && terraform init && terraform apply # Deploys EC2 instance to AWS
